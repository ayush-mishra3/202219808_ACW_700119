### Feature list:

- [x] Underwater environment. 

- [x] Procedural sea floor. 

- [ ] Coral objects. 
    
    - [ ] Vertex shader-based coral object. 
    - [x] Pixel shader-based coral object. 
    - [x] Geometry shader-based coral object. 
    - [ ] Hull and domain shader-based coral objects. 

- [x] Reflective bubbles. 

- [x] A shoal of colourful coral reef fish created as a particle system.
    
    - [x] Create a list of vertices in your C++ program and write a geometry shader to turn each vertex in the list into a quad centred at the original vertex position with a size of [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
    - [x] Regard the collection of quads generated from the geometry shader as a collection of quad particles and use them to animate a shoal of colourful coral reef fish.

- [x] Implicit sea plant modelling and animation. Model and animate some sea plants either as an explicit object in vertex shader or geometry shaders,  or as a kind of distance function and visualized using the ray marching technique.

- [x] Novelty and own effects.
